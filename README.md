# Nausicaa

**Spring 2015**

Led a small interdisciplinary team to outfit a modular concrete structure with a compact, flexible audio-video recording system for the UVa International Studies Office.  The following excerpt from the user manual I wrote captures the goals of this project.

>Nausicaa emerged from the intersection of technology and design as a distinctly interdisciplinary project. Students and faculty from the UVa School of Architecture designed and built the modular, mobile concrete structure as a locale for interviews as well as a passive outdoor seating option. A small cohort of undergraduate School of Engineering students outfitted the structure with a compact, flexible audio-video recording system. Natural and unobtrusive on the beautiful backdrop of UVa grounds, the Nausicaa system harbors an intimate environment that evokes and captures genuine recollections of the UVa global community.
